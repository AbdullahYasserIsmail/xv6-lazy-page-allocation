# Lazy Memory Allocation in xv6

This project is a modified version of [MIT xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/), an instructional re-implementation of Unix Version 6 for RISC-V. The core enhancement here is the implementation of **lazy memory allocation**—physical memory is allocated for user processes only when a page is first accessed, rather than when it is initially requested.

## What is xv6?

xv6 is a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system developed at MIT for the RISC-V architecture. It is used primarily for educational purposes in operating system courses and as a reference for OS design.

## About This Project

This repository demonstrates an operating systems memory management technique called **lazy (or deferred) page allocation**. Instead of allocating all requested user memory up front, the kernel allocates pages only when they are actually accessed by the process (typically via a page fault).

## Key Features and Implementation

### 1. Modified `sbrk()` System Call

- `sbrk()` now only adjusts the declared size of a process’s virtual address space (`p->sz`).
- No physical memory is allocated during `sbrk()`, except when shrinking the memory region (where memory is freed if needed).

### 2. On-Demand Page Allocation

- When a user process accesses a virtual page for the first time and triggers a page fault, the trap handler (`usertrap()` in `trap.c`) allocates a physical page, zeroes it, and maps it into the process’s page table.
- If the faulting address is outside the process's allocated (valid) space, the process is killed.

### 3. Safe Deallocation and Copying

- Deallocation (`uvmunmap`) safely skips unmapped (never-faulted) pages.
- When processes are forked, only mapped pages are copied to the child (`uvmcopy`). Unallocated pages are lazily faulted in by the child if needed.
- The kernel is updated to handle copying to unmapped user pages gracefully in `copyout`, while `copyin` and `copyinstr` maintain vanilla xv6 behavior for safety.

### 4. Utilities: Page Table Printer and Testing

- A `vmprint` function is provided to print the process’s page table, aiding in debugging of page table structures and lazy mapping.
- The included `lazytest` user program helps test lazy allocation functionality; it allocates memory, sparsely accesses it, and demonstrates page-by-page allocation.

## How to Build and Run

1. Install a RISC-V "newlib" toolchain and QEMU (see MIT xv6 instructions).
2. Clone this repository and run:
    ```sh
    make qemu
    ```
3. To observe lazy allocation, run the provided `lazytest` user program in the xv6 shell.

## Why Lazy Allocation?

Lazy (deferred) page allocation enhances efficiency by preventing allocation of pages that may never be used. This is ideal for programs that allocate large buffers or heaps but only use a small portion, thus saving memory and reducing startup costs.
